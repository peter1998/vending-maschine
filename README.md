## Description
This application simulates the functionality of a vending machine. Users can view products, insert coins, purchase products, and receive change. The application manages an inventory count of the products and only allows a user to purchase if the product is in stock and they have inserted sufficient funds.

## Set up this app
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm.
## Installing and Running Vending Machine Application
To install the Vending Machine Application, follow these steps:

# +Clone this repository onto your local machine.
 +Navigate into the project directory: cd vending-machine.
 +Install the project dependencies with npm: npm install.

## Accepted Coin Denominations
The vending machine accepts the following coin denominations (USD): $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1.

## Running the tests
 I can suggest five test cases:
TODO!
+Check if the VendingMachine component renders.
+Check if a product can be selected.
+Check if coins can be inserted.
+Check if a purchase can be confirmed.
+Check if the process can be reset.
