## Description

This application simulates the functionality of a real-world vending machine. Users can view a list of available products, insert coins, make a product selection, and purchase products. The application manages an inventory count for the products and only allows users to purchase if the product is in stock and if they have inserted sufficient funds.

## Setup and Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm.

To install the Vending Machine Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd vending-machine`.
3. Install the project dependencies with npm: `npm install`.
4. Start the application: `npm start`.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Coin Denominations

The vending machine accepts the following coin denominations (in USD): $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1.

## Running Tests

Run tests using `npm test`. This should start the test runner, Jest, in the project. Currently, there are five test cases:

- Check if the VendingMachine component renders.
- Check if a product can be selected.
- Check if coins can be inserted.
- Check if a purchase can be confirmed.
- Check if the process can be reset.
